## About Me

Hello! Welcome to my website! I am an associate professor (untenured) at [Antai College of Economics and Management](https://www.acem.sjtu.edu.cn/en/), Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU). I received my Ph.D. in 2019 from the [Quantitative Methods](https://business.purdue.edu/academics/quantitative-methods/) at [Mitch Daniels School of Business](https://business.purdue.edu/), Purdue University, where I was advised by Professor [Mohit Tawarmalani](https://web.ics.purdue.edu/~mtawarma/). 

My research interests are in <b>mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP)</b>, including theory, algorithms, computation and applications. I am particularly interested in developing <b>convexification</b> techniques and efficient algorithms for solving MINLPs. Recently, I am also interested in using ideas from MINLP to improve decision-making in data science, and in operations involving <b>consumer choice behavior</b>.
